\description{
A dataset containing daily total delays of major U.S. airlines.
The raw data was obtained from the U.S.
\href{https://www.bts.dot.gov/}{Bureau of Transportation Statistics},
and pre-processed as described in
\insertCite{hen2022;textual}{graphicalExtremes}.
\emph{Note: The CRAN version of this package contains only data from 2010-2013.}
\emph{The full dataset is available in the GitHub version of this package.}
}
\details{
\code{flightCounts} is a three-dimensional array, containing the number of flights in the dataset
between each pair of airports, aggregated on a yearly basis.
Each entry is the total number of flights between the departure airport (row)
and destination airport (column) in a given year (dimension 3).
This array does not contain any \code{NA}s, even if an airport did not operate
at all in a given year, which is simply indicated by zeros.

\code{delays} is a three-dimensional array containing daily total positive delays,
in minutes, of incoming and outgoing flights respectively.
Each column corresponds to an airport in the dataset and each row corresponds
to a day. The third dimension has length two, \code{'arrivals'} containing delays of
incoming flights and \code{'departures'} containing delays of outgoing flights.
Zeros indicate that there were flights arriving/departing at that airport
on a given day, but none of them had delays. \code{NA}s indicate that there were
no flights arriving/departing at that airport on that day at all.

\code{airports} is a data frame containing the following information about a number of US airports.
Some entries are missing, which is indicated by \code{NA}s.
\describe{
\item{\code{IATA}}{3-letter IATA code}
\item{\code{Name}}{name of the airport}
\item{\code{City}}{main city served by the airport}
\item{\code{Country}}{country or territory where the airport is located (mostly \code{"United States"})}
\item{\code{ICAO}}{4-letter ICAO code}
\item{\code{Latitude}}{latitude of the airport, in decimal degrees}
\item{\code{Longitude}}{longitude of the airport, in decimal degrees}
\item{\code{Altitude}}{altitude of the airport, in feet}
\item{\code{Timezone}}{timezone of the airport, in hours offset from UTC}
\item{\code{DST}}{Daylight savings time used at the airport. 'A'=US/Canada, 'N'=None.}
\item{\code{Timezone2}}{name of the timezone of the airport}
}
}
\examples{
# Get total number of flights in the dataset:
totalFlightCounts <- apply(flights$flightCounts, c(1,2), sum)

# Get number of flights for specific years in the dataset:
flightCounts_08_09 <- apply(flights$flightCounts[,,c('2008', '2009')], c(1,2), sum)

# Get list of connections from 2008:
connections_08 <- flightCountMatrixToConnectionList(flights$flightCounts[,,'2008'])
